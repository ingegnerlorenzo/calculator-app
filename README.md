## Overview

Calculator design! Pretty easy for me to figure out the css and html, way less immediate the JS part!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
-Vanilla Javascript
### What I learned
Coding is so hard! I was able to build the theme switch and some really basic calculator features all by myself; no problem with the css and html workflow, I felt pretty confident. But when it came on figuring out how to make the calculator doing the big job it was pretty damn hard! Thanks to a useful youtube video by Web Dev Simplified I was able to do it. 

### Continued development

I definitely need to strengthen my logic abilities in Javascript, even if I'm more concerned on designing.
